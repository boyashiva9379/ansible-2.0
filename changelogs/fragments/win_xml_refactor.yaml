minor_changes:
  - win_xml - Behaviour change, module now processes all nodes specified by xpath, not just first encountered.
  - win_xml - Behaviour change, fragment no longer required when processing element type nodes and state=absent.
  - win_xml - Some output messages worded differently now the module uses a generic method to save changes.
  - win_xml - Added 'count' module parameter which will return number of nodes matched by xpath if set to yes/true
