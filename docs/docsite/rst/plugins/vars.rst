Vars Plugins
============

.. contents::

   :depth: 2

Vars plugins inject additional variable data into Ansible runs that did not come from an inventory source, playbook, or command line. Playbook constructs like 'host_vars' and 'group_vars' work using vars plugins.

Vars plugins were partially implemented in Ansible 2.0 and rewritten to be fully implemented starting with Ansible 2.4.

The :ref:`host_group_vars <host_group_vars_vars>` plugin shipped with Ansible enables reading variables from :ref:`host_variables` and :ref:`group_variables`.


.. _enable_vars:

Enabling vars plugins
---------------------

You can activate a custom vars plugin by either dropping it into a ``vars_plugins`` directory adjacent to your play,  inside a role, or by putting it in one of the directory sources configured in :ref:`ansible.cfg <ansible_configuration_settings>`.


.. _using_vars:

Using vars plugins
------------------

Vars plugins are used automatically after they are enabled.


.. _vars_plugin_list:

Plugin Lists
------------

You can use ``ansible-doc -t vars -l`` to see the list of available plugins.
Use ``ansible-doc -t vars <plugin name>`` to see specific plugin-specific documentation and examples.
