Coding Guidelines
=================

Hi! Thanks for your interest in contributing to Ansible. We document our Coding Guidelines in the [Developer Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/). We particularly suggest you review:

* [Contributing your module to Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_modules_checklist.html)

* [Development conventions, tips and pitfalls](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_modules_best_practices.html)

Our [Community Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/) may also help you connect with the community of Ansible developers.
